<h1>INTERNET OF THINGS</h1>

postedon:22 aug<br>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
<p>

The Internet of Things may be a hot topic in the industry but it’s not a new concept. In the early 2000’s, Kevin Ashton was laying the groundwork for what would<br>
 become the Internet of Things (IoT) at MIT’s AutoID lab. Ashton was one of the pioneers who conceived this notion as he searched for ways that Proctor & Gamble<br>
 could improve its business by linking RFID information to the Internet. The concept was simple but powerful. If all objects in daily life were equipped with<br>
 identifiers and wireless connectivity, these objects could be communicate with each other and be managed by computers. In a 1999 article for the RFID Journal<br> 
 Ashton wrote: “If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any help from us -- we would be able to<br>
 track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were<br>
 fresh or past their best. We need to empower computers with their own means of gathering information, so they can see, hear and smell the world for themselves, <br>
 in all its random glory. RFID and sensor technology enable computers to observe, identify At the time, this vision required major technology improvements. After<br> 
 all, how would we connect everything on the planet? What type of wireless communications could be built into devices? What changes would need to be made to the <br>
 existing Internet infrastructure to support billions of new devices communicating? What would power these devices? What must be developed to make the solutions <br>
 cost effective? There were more questions than answers to the IoT concepts in 1999. Today, many of these obstacles have been solved. The size and cost of wireles<br>
 s radios has dropped tremendously. IPv6 allows us to assign a communications address to billions of devices. Electronics companies are building Wi-Fi and ce<br>
 llular wireless connectivity into a wide range of devices. ABI Research estimates over five billion wireless chips will ship in 2013.2 Mobile data coverage has<br> 
 improved significantly with many networks offering broadband speeds.<br>

<h2>HISTORY OF INTERNET OF THINGS</h2>
<p>

The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) was first used in 1999 by British technology pioneer Kevin Ashton to describe a system in which objects in the physical<br> 
world could be connected to the Internet by sensors.12 Ashton coined the term to illustrate the power of connecting Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) <br>
tags13 used in corporate supply chains to the Internet in order to count and track goods without the need for human intervention. Today, the Internet of Things<br>
 has become a popular term for describing scenarios in which Internet connectivity and computing capability extend to a variety of objects, devices, sensors,<br>
 and everyday items. While the term “Internet of Things” is relatively new, the concept of combining computers and networks to monitor and control devices has<br>
 been around for decades. By the late 1970s, for example, systems for remotely monitoring meters on the electrical grid via telephone lines were already in <br>
 commercial use.14 In the 1990s, advances in wireless technology allowed “machine–to–machine” (M2M) enterprise and industrial solutions for equipment monitoring<br>
 and operation to become widespread. Many of these early M2M solutions, however, were based on closed purpose–built networks and proprietary or industry–specif<br>
 ic standards,15 rather than on Internet Protocol (IP)–based networks and Internet standards.
